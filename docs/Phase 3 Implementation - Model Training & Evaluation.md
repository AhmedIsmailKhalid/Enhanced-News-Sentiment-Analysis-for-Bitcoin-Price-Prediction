## Core Components

### 1. Target Variable Generation

**File:** `src/data_processing/feature_engineering/target_generator.py`

**Purpose:** Create binary classification target for price prediction

**Target Definition:**
- **1 (UP):** Price increases over prediction horizon
- **0 (DOWN):** Price decreases over prediction horizon
- **Default horizon:** 1 hour ahead

**Key Features:**
- Configurable prediction horizon
- Automatic target distribution logging
- Price change percentage calculation
- Removal of samples without valid targets

**Example Output:**
```python
Created target variable for 70 samples (1h prediction horizon)
Target distribution: UP=34, DOWN=36
# Nearly balanced classes (48.6% up, 51.4% down)
```

---

### 2. Data Preparation Pipeline

**File:** `src/models/training_pipeline/data_preparation.py`

**Purpose:** Load features, create splits, scale data for training

#### **Feature Loading**
- Loads feature sets from database (local or NeonDB)
- Supports both VADER and FinBERT feature sets
- JSON deserialization from `feature_data` table
- Automatic numeric column filtering

#### **Train/Val/Test Splitting**
- **Train:** 70% (49 samples from 70 total)
- **Validation:** 10% (7 samples)
- **Test:** 20% (14 samples)
- Stratified splits maintain class balance
- Random state for reproducibility

#### **Feature Scaling**
- StandardScaler (zero mean, unit variance)
- Fit only on training data
- Transform train/val/test identically
- Prevents data leakage

**Non-Numeric Column Handling:**
```python
# Automatically excluded from training:
exclude_cols = [
    'timestamp', 'collected_at', 'processed_at',
    'target', 'future_price', 'price_change_pct',
    'symbol', 'name', 'data_source'  # String columns
]
```

---

### 3. Model Training Pipeline

**File:** `src/models/training_pipeline/model_trainer.py`

**Purpose:** Train, evaluate, and persist classification models

#### **Supported Algorithms**

**Logistic Regression:**
```python
LogisticRegression(
    max_iter=1000,
    class_weight='balanced',  # Handle class imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```
- Fast training
- Good for small datasets
- Interpretable coefficients
- Built-in regularization

**Random Forest:**
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    class_weight='balanced',
    n_jobs=-1,
    random_state=42
)
```
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Feature importance available
- Resistant to overfitting (with tuning)
- Parallel training

**Gradient Boosting:**
```python
GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=5,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    random_state=42
)
```
- Sequential ensemble
- Often best performance
- Careful tuning required
- Slower training

#### **Training Process**
1. Initialize model with configuration
2. Fit on training data
3. Generate training predictions and metrics
4. Generate validation predictions and metrics
5. Extract feature importance (if available)
6. Return complete results dictionary

#### **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision:** True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall:** True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC AUC:** Area under receiver operating characteristic curve

---

### 4. Financial Metrics Evaluation

**File:** `src/models/evaluation/financial_metrics.py`

**Purpose:** Calculate trading-specific performance measures

#### **Directional Accuracy**
- Percentage of correct price direction predictions
- More relevant than raw accuracy for trading

#### **Trading Performance Simulation**
```python
Strategy:
- Predict UP → Go long (buy)
- Predict DOWN → Go short (sell)
- Correct prediction → Gain price change %
- Wrong prediction → Lose price change %
- Apply transaction costs (0.1% per trade)
```

**Calculated Metrics:**
- **Total Return %:** Cumulative profit/loss
- **Average Return %:** Mean per-trade return
- **Win Rate:** Percentage of profitable trades
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted returns
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Profit Factor:** Gross profit / Gross loss ratio

#### **Example Results:**
```json
{
    "total_return_pct": 2.5,
    "avg_return_pct": 0.18,
    "win_rate": 0.57,
    "winning_trades": 8,
    "losing_trades": 6,
    "sharpe_ratio": 0.34,
    "max_drawdown_pct": -1.2,
    "total_trades": 14
}
```

---

### 5. Model Comparison Framework

**File:** `src/models/evaluation/model_comparator.py`

**Purpose:** Compare VADER vs FinBERT feature sets

#### **Performance Comparison**
Creates side-by-side comparison:
- Model name
- VADER validation accuracy & F1
- FinBERT validation accuracy & F1
- Accuracy difference (FinBERT - VADER)
- F1 score difference
- Winner determination

#### **Statistical Significance Testing**

**McNemar's Test:**
- Tests if prediction differences are statistically significant
- Uses 2×2 contingency table of agreement/disagreement
- Chi-squared statistic and p-value
- Significant if p < 0.05

**Contingency Table:**
```
                    FinBERT Correct    FinBERT Wrong
VADER Correct              A                B
VADER Wrong                C                D
```

**Interpretation:**
- Both models agree (A+D): No information
- Disagreement (B+C): Test significance
- If p < 0.05: Performance difference is real, not chance

#### **Overall Winner Determination**
1. Count wins per feature set across all models
2. If tied, use average validation accuracy
3. Declare winner: VADER, FinBERT, or Tie

## Current Performance Results

### Dataset Statistics

**Total Samples:** 70  
**Training:** 49 samples  
**Validation:** 7 samples  
**Test:** 14 samples  
**Features:** 106 (VADER), 111 (FinBERT)  
**Target Distribution:** 48.6% UP, 51.4% DOWN (balanced)

### Model Performance

**Random Forest (Best Performer):**

| Metric | VADER | FinBERT |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Train Accuracy | 95.92% | 95.92% |
| Val Accuracy | 57.14% | 57.14% |

- **No predictive power:** Test accuracy = random chance
- **ROC AUC < 0.5:** Worse than random guessing
- **Identical performance:** VADER = FinBERT (both ineffective)

### Statistical Significance

**McNemar's Test Results:**
- Chi-squared: 0.0000
- P-value: 1.0000
- Significant: No
- Conclusion: No statistical difference between VADER and FinBERT

**Winner:** Tie (both perform equally at random chance level)

## Performance Analysis

### Why Models Fail

**1. Insufficient Data**
- **Current:** 70 samples
- **Required:** 500-1000 samples minimum
- **Rule of Thumb:** Need 5-10 samples per feature
- **Current Ratio:** 70 samples / 106 features = 0.66 (severely underfitted)

**2. Curse of Dimensionality**
- 106 features with only 49 training samples
- Models memorize noise instead of patterns
- No generalization to unseen data

**3. Limited Temporal Coverage**
- Only 20 hours of data (2025-10-03)
- Missing diverse market conditions
- No bull/bear market variety
- No weekend vs weekday patterns

**4. Overfitting Indicators**
- Train accuracy: 96%
- Test accuracy: 50%
- 46 percentage point gap
- Model memorizes training data perfectly but learns nothing generalizable

### Expected Performance with Adequate Data

**With 500-1000 Samples:**
- Train accuracy: 65-70%
- Test accuracy: 60-65%
- ROC AUC: 0.60-0.65
- Overfitting gap: 5-10 percentage points
- Meaningful feature set comparison possible

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Non-Numeric Columns in Features

**Problem:** Feature data included string columns ('symbol', 'name', 'data_source') causing sklearn to crash.

**Error:**
```
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'BTC'
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Filter to only numeric columns
feature_cols = []
for col in all_cols:
    if col not in exclude_cols:
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]):
            feature_cols.append(col)
```

**Lesson:** Always validate data types before passing to sklearn.

---

### Challenge 2: Database Selection in Training Scripts

**Problem:** Training script defaulted to local database with only 5 samples.

**Initial Error:**
```
Insufficient data: 5 samples (minimum: 30)
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Make database selection explicit
features_df = data_prep.load_features_from_db(
    feature_set_name=feature_set,
    target_db="neondb_production",  # Explicit selection
    min_samples=30
)
```

**Lesson:** Always make critical configuration explicit, not implicit.

---

### Challenge 3: Insufficient Training Data

**Problem:** Only 70 samples for 106 features leads to severe overfitting.

**Observation:**
- Train: 96% accuracy
- Test: 50% accuracy (random)
- Model has no predictive power

**Solution Options Considered:**

**Option A: Feature Selection**
- Reduce to top 20-30 features
- Still won't solve fundamental data shortage
- Rejected: Doesn't address root cause

**Option B: Wait for More Data**
- Let pipeline accumulate 500-1000 samples
- 1-2 weeks of collection needed
- Selected: Proper solution for production ML

**Option C: Use Pre-trained Models**
- Transfer learning from similar tasks
- Adds complexity
- Rejected: Out of scope

**Decision:** Continue data collection, proceed with Phase 4 implementation.

---

### Challenge 4: Class Imbalance (Potential)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Set `class_weight='balanced'` in all models
- Monitors target distribution in logs
- Current dataset is naturally balanced (48.6% / 51.4%)

**If Imbalance Occurs:**
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Adjust class weights
- Use F1 score instead of accuracy

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Three Model Comparison

**Decision:** Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

**Rationale:**
- Different complexity levels (simple → complex)
- Logistic Regression: Fast, interpretable, good with limited data
- Random Forest: Ensemble, feature importance, parallel training
- Gradient Boosting: Often best performance, sequential ensemble
- Provides robust comparison across model families

**Alternative Considered:** Single best model
**Why Rejected:** Need diversity to find best approach for this specific problem

---

### 2. 70/10/20 Train/Val/Test Split

**Decision:** 70% train, 10% validation, 20% test

**Rationale:**
- Standard ML practice for small datasets
- Validation set for hyperparameter tuning
- Test set never touched during development
- Stratified splits maintain class balance

**Alternative Considered:** 80/20 without validation
**Why Rejected:** Need separate validation for model selection

---

### 3. StandardScaler for Normalization

**Decision:** Use StandardScaler (z-score normalization)

**Rationale:**
- Different features have different scales (prices in thousands, percentages in decimals)
- Improves convergence for gradient-based models
- Standard practice for mixed-scale features
- Preserves distribution shape

**Alternative Considered:** MinMaxScaler
**Why Rejected:** Sensitive to outliers, StandardScaler more robust

---

### 4. Model Persistence Strategy

**Decision:** Save models with joblib, metadata with JSON

**Rationale:**
- Joblib efficient for sklearn models
- JSON human-readable for metadata
- Timestamp-based naming for versioning
- Separate directories per feature set and model type

**Alternative Considered:** MLflow for tracking
**Why Rejected:** Added complexity, overkill for portfolio project

---

### 5. Financial Metrics Addition

**Decision:** Include trading simulation alongside ML metrics

**Rationale:**
- Standard ML metrics don't reflect trading viability
- Profit factor and Sharpe ratio matter for deployment
- Transaction costs significantly impact profitability
- Demonstrates understanding of production ML for finance

**Alternative Considered:** ML metrics only
**Why Rejected:** Incomplete picture for financial application

- **Week 2 (Oct 10-17):** 1000 samples → Production-ready models
- **Week 4 (Oct 17-31):** 2000 samples → Robust, reliable models

### Monitoring Plan
1. Check feature_data table daily:
```sql
SELECT 
    feature_set_name,
    COUNT(*) as samples,
    MIN(timestamp) as start_date,
    MAX(timestamp) as end_date
FROM feature_data
GROUP BY feature_set_name;
```

2. Re-run training weekly to track improvement
3. Monitor overfitting gap (train - test accuracy)
4. Target: Gap < 10 percentage points
